Convention for Platform Project:


1. Use as much C++ conventions as possible

Purpose of this is to not confuse any current computer science students
who are currently taking C++ classes.

* These Javascript conventions are introduced in the beginning but not suggested to be used.
  Students already familiar with these are highly recommended to use them.

  a. Use "" instead of ''
  b. Use == instead of ===

2. Followings are conventions for js file:

These conventions are not forced nor suggested, but for uniformity and readability.

  a. all conventions mentioned in #1
  b. double space indentation with no tabs
  c. all {} brackets are done this way:
      function name()
      {
      }
  d. put spaces when using operators
    i.    (a == b)
    ii.   (x && y)
    iii.  for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)

3. Use following comment for pointing out new code for the week:

//comment*
  code;
//

It's easier to read new materials and new/old codes.


4. Use following comment for pointing out challenges

//Challenge*
  code
//

  a.Challenge's level can be written with number of '!'. Ex:

  //Challenge!!*
    code
  //

  b. These are expectations for each level:
    i.    level 0 are expected to be completed by next meeting.
          They are mostly repeatitive and simple.
          We will not go over these in future meetings. (aka. homework/labwork)
    ii.   level 1 are future codes that will be shown in future meetings.
          Whether people do it or not, it will be explained in meeting in future.
    iii.  level 2 are expected to not show up or work with future code.
          They are pure purpose is for just playing around with new command lines.
    iv.   level 3 are not expected to be done by most people.
          Most likely, level 3 are not going to show up in future code.
