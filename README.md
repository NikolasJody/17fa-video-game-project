# SideShooter
A JavaScript based 2D platformer shooter game using Phaser.io for dvcoders. (Upload each week)

# Purpose
Basic setup code, files, and weekly update will be posted here so that even members who misses a week or so can still follow up.

# Conventions
Most of javascript's unique convention will not be used since most of dvcoders' students learn C++. More details are listed in convention.txt
